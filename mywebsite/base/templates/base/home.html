                    <h4>My Journey in IT </h4>
                <hr>
                <p> 2 years ago I started learning how to code and after writing my fisrt Hello World program on May 2022 After a year ago
                    I applayed many jobs and had been looking forward to responce But Unfortunately, I got rejections and I was like very sad.
                    Then, I started creating various interesting projects to be better version of myself everyday.</p>

                <p>I knew my weakness where i have to work to step out of them. One of my weakness was algorithms.
                    and I found leetcode where i could solve some complex problems to enhance my weakness.</p>

                <p>From this you will be able to see that I'm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary</p>
